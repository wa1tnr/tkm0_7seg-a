  For this branch's present state of revision (working
  blinkie) -- the state of this repository is now 

        TESTED as GOOD    and is complete.

  Program is complete (build it stand-alone).

  Target is currently: Adafruit Metro M4 Express.

  The Feather M4 Express also works; it's just a blinkie.

  Each one's blinkie is on a different pin (PA16, PA23).

  (see gpio_local.c)

  So *both* of these pins toggle on *both* devices.
